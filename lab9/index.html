			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries and jQuery</h1>
			<div id ="challenge", class = "minor-section">
						<h2> Challenge</h2>
						<p>For this lab, we were needed to utilize jQuery for the first time. We appended buttons to our HTML, and created code that caused some colors to change when a button is pressed.</p>
			</div>

			<div id ="problems", class = "minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Surprisingly, I had few problems with the Javascript syntax like I did in previous labs. However, I did struggle with making the buttons function as they should. I ended up needing to look over the example from Wes' website, as well as check W3 schools, to see what I was doing wrong. </p>
			</div>

			<div id ="reflections", class = "minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall, I think this went really well! I even later went on to edit down my Javascript to be just four lines of code. I was also considering implementing something Wes' website had, with a "party button." </p>
			</div>

			<div id ="results", class = "minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
						<p> Read em and weep, cowboy! Click the buttons and see what happens! </p>
