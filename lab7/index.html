			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> For this lab, we needed to work with functions. We were tasked with creating a function that prompted the user to give their name. Then, the function sorts the letters of their name alphabetically and displays it for the user. </p>
			</div>		

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> My lab partner and I came across several problems during the process of working on the lab. Notably, we found it difficult to output the results of our function. Some of this was the result of our function being written incorrectly (for instance, I accidentally misspelled one of my variables). Other things were more confusing. For instance, both of us had to deal with the function being run twice, resulting in multiple boxes popping up rather than just one. This turned out to be a problem with our HTML, not our Javascript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> The bio on my homepage was themed off of the idea of myself as a wizard, stuck inside of the computer after tampering with the arcane arts of HTML. Here, I wanted to expand upon this and provide an opportunity for the user to meet with the wizard... and perhaps be cursed as a result. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Below you can see the results of my lab. </p>
					<div id="output">
						<h2> It's never a good idea to give a wizard your name... </h2>
						<p> As the words leave your fingers, you see the vestige of the wizard laugh maniacally.</p>
						<p> "Fool! I have you now! You once thought you knew your name, but I have changed it!" </p>
