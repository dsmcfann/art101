			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> In this lab, we needed to use psuedocode to describe both an everyday task, as well as the steps to playing a game. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Creating the psuedocode was not a major problem, either for myself or my lab partner. The issue, however, was during Task One. As I tried to create an ordered list to list the steps for taking the bus, the appearance on my website kept look awful. It looked almost like how a typewriter looks when it types over itself. I only fixed it by removing the some css from site.css which previously created a more aesthetically pleasing navigation bar. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Doing this lab allowed me to practice pseudocode, something that I thought I would be very bad at. In the end, I still think I have a lot to learn about how to break down the tasks into subtasks... but I'm learning! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
						<p> <b>Task One: Pseudocode an Everyday Task. For this, we decided to talk about how to get to the BayTree Bookstore from the Porter/Rachel Carson Bus Stop.  </b></p>
						<ol type="1">
							<li> Be present at the Rachel Carson/Porter Bus Stop. </li>
							<li> Watch towards the left for oncoming cars and busses. Wait until you see either a loop bus or a Santa Cruz Metro City bus.
								<ol> 
									<li> If the bus is a Santa Cruz Metro bus, take out your student ID. </li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li> When the bus arrives at the bus stop, get into a line with all other students waiting to board the bus. </li>
							<li> Board the bus with the other students.
								<ol>
									<li> If on a Santa Cruz Metro Bus, show bus driver your student ID. </li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li> Find a seat on the bus. </li>
								<ol>
									<li> Walk to an open seat. </li>
									<li> Sit down in the seat. </li>
									<li> If no other seats are available... 
									
									 	<ol>
											<li> Find an open space to stand. </li>
											<li> Grab onto a handle in the bus, and hold on. </li>
										</ol>
										</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li> Remain on the bus for 5 stops. </li>
							<li> After the bus leaves from the College 9/10 stop, reach up your hand and pull the stop cord. 
								<ol> 
									<li> Wait for the bus to stop at Hagar Dr. </li>
									<li> Get off bus when bus stops. </li>
								</ol> </li>
							<li> Facing the bus stop, turn to your right and walk across the street. 
								<ol>
									<li> Continue to walk forward. </li>
									<li> When you walk to the middle of the square, turn to the left. </li>
									<li> Look at the sign that says Baytree Bookstore. </li>
								</ol> </li>
							<li> Walk into the open door of the Baytree Bookstore. </li>
						</ol>
					<p> <b> Task Three: Pseudocode for a game. See what the code looks like below! </b></p>

<pre><code> 
// Sticks
// Practicing with Pseudocode!
// Donovan and Mason 
// October 2024
							
	//Create Visual gameboard
		//At start, draw two hands. fingers = points. each hand has one finger displayed at start of game.
		//Without telling player, assign “points”. at start of game, each player has two “points”.
	//First Player Moves (two possibilities)
		//Attack: Player chooses one of their hands
			//and chooses one of their opponent’s “hands” to attack]
		//Split
			//Player chooses one of their hands and chooses how many points to to move from one hand to their other. ex hand1 has 4 points, hand 2 has 1, player “splits” and moves two points from hand 1 to hand 2.
			  //Can not split points to be more than five per hand ie can not force their own hand from play.
			  //Can not split points to dead hand.
	//Validate move
		//If attack, add numerical value of fingers displayed from player's hand to opponent’s hand. ie, if player’s hands = x, and opponent’s hand equals y, add x and y to create new hand for opponent.
			//If points for opponents hand equal or above 5, stop counting and remove hand from play.
		//If split, subtract chosen numerical value of points from one hand and add to the other hand.
			//If points on one hand equals or exceeds or exceed 5, return error and
				//Go back to step 2
	//Redraw gameboard to match current points
		//Display for both opponents
		//If numerical value on either players hand equals or exceeds 5 at end of turn, stop counting and remove hand from play.
	//Test for win condition
		  //If one players points at or above 10, end game. other player is declared winner]
			//Else, move to next player
	  
	// Second Player Moves (two possibilities)
		//Attack: Player chooses one of their hands
			//and chooses one of their opponent’s “hands” to attack]
		//Split
			//Player chooses one of their hands and chooses how many points to to move from one hand to their other. ex hand1 has 4 points, hand 2 has 1, player “splits” and moves two points from hand 1 to hand 2.
