			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2> Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we were reviewing functions, including our newly discovered anonymous functions, and using them to do some basic calculations. We tested this on both our console's browser and included it in the Javascript file on our lab page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Few problems arose during this lab. However, when I started Task 2 I ran into several difficulties with creating a named function - this is because I was accidentally putting a number in for "x" instead of the variable x. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall, this lab was fine. It was not super intense, but it was sometimes still a little confusing with the syntax of Javascript. I know that's something that will get better the more that I do it, though! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> See my results on my console... for now! (I will soon do Task X and utilize jQuery).</p>
