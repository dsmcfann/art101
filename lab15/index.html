			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2> Challenge</h2>
					<p> For this lab, we needed to utilize our new knowledge of AJAX and APIs to connect an already existing API to our website. I initially wanted to add the PokeAPI to my website, which I though would be fun given my love of the Pokemon franchise. Eventually, I decided to switch to a different API based on Dungeons and Dragons spells.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Despite having the example of the successful lab from Mason, who showcased how to make the lab function using the "YesNo" API, I found quite a bit of difficulty making the lab function the way it was supposed to. I also could not figure out how to output the JSON as HTML onto the page. However, I eventually made it work using a different API and also through some trial and error.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Though I had quite a few problems in the creation of this lab, making these errors allowed me to learn even more about how APIs and AJAX worked. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>A sigil, carved in to the wall in the depths of a cave.</h2>
					<p> Approaching the sigil, you see it begin to glow. You think that, were you to <i> click </i> the sigil, you might  learn a new spell. 
					<br> It is also possible, however, that you could explode into ten billion pieces. But the likelihood of that is like... very low, I think.</p>
