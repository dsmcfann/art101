			<h1>Lab 10 - Javascript for the Web </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2> Challenge</h2>
					<p> For this lab, we were asked to create a JavaScript/jQuery script that appends new elements to an output div.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Few problems arose with the main tasks of the lab, but we found some difficulties solving Task X. Eventually, we were successfully able to solve those problems. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I really enjoyed this assignment! It also gave me the chance to explore the world of the Arcane Wizard Donovan a little further. See below. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Slowly, slowly, you make your way up the wizard's tower...</h2>
					<p> You open an unlocked wooden door. Inside, a table atop which sits a ... device? ... crafted of metal and glass. Next to it, a writing implement and instructions: </p>
					<p> <i> I wish to share my arcane secrets with the world. Please, ask me something, and I'll be happy to find a spell that should solve your problems...</i></p>
					<p> I mean, what's the worse that could happen, right? Try typing something in and see what the wizard responds with. It's an old tablet, so the wizard may take a moment to respond.</p>
