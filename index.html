			<h2> About Me </h2>
				<img class="image-photo" src="img/donovan image.png" >
					<p > Ah, so we meet at last... the stars above foretold your arrival many years ago, of course, but to see you here, now...</p>
					<p> But of course, where are my manners? My name is <b> Donovan Sayegh-McFann. </b> Before you came here, I was an Anthropology and Education, Democracy, and Justice double major at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Though I pursued my hobbies in music, puppetry, I had a secret craving that I longed to fulfill: </p>
						<p style="text-align: center;"> <b> A craving for the arcane arts of HTML coding and web design. </b></p>
					<p> Despite the judgement of my fellows, and the pleading of my loved ones, I delved deep into the murky darkness of HTML, CSS and JS. I learned how to apply text to a webpage, use my powers to make it appear <b1> BIG </b1> or <i1> small</i1>, just from the brush of my fingers. I felt the coding power surging through my finger tips. There was nothing I could not do: I was unstoppable. </p>
					<p> But yet, all good things must come to an end. In a moment of hubris, while attempting to use the most powerful of HTML spells, I inadvertently captured <i> m y s e l f </i> onto the webpage. Despite my attempts to escape, I had already pushed myself from my local repository to the Net. I was trapped. This is all that remains of me...</p>
					<p> But wait... perhaps... </p>
						<p style="text-align: center;"> <b1> you could help me? </b1></p>
					<p> Before I uploaded myself, I had backed up all of my work exploring these arcane arts to this webpage in the forms of "labs". If you were to explore them, to <b> <i> click </i></b> on each of the links on the left, perhaps you could find a way to help me? Or, at least, you could learn from my folly on your own journey through the arcane.</p>
					<p> The choice is yours. In the meantime, I think I will continue to rest here on this homepage. Take care of yourself, my friend. And good luck.</p>
