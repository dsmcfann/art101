			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> In this lab, we were asked to experiment and practice using Javascript, both in the browser console and in our code. This included making a boolean function, creating a new variable, and "printing" these values, either on the console or on our website. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> My biggest issue for this lab came about from the pecularities with writing Javascript. For instance, when doing the first task, I inadvertently used a color instead of an equal sign to declare a variable. This, obviously, did not declare the variable, and if you look at the pdf document with my lab information, you can see that an error occured in the console during Task One. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall, I think that this was a fine first time writing in Javascript. Though I ran into issues, I found way to rectify them alongside my partner. I am already thinking about how to use Javascript on other portions of the website - notably, in my "navigation" bar, which currently functions purely through HTML and CSS. </p>
